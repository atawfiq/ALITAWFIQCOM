I am forever fascinated by early stage product development especially in the tech, online learning, online communities, digital health and social spaces. Coming through with an engineering background Iâ€™ve enjoyed working on changing the way consumers, service providers and researchers interact with emerging technology. I love to get my hands dirty with all aspects of product development, from business to coding and back. I've most recently founded, built and scaled <a href="https://www.goboomerang.com" target="_blank">Boomerang</a> into a business with over 70k baby boomers looking to explore their passions as they approach retirement. 

Some of the things I've done in the past: 
Online social platforms and communities, online education, photography, wearable technology, team building, product vision, product optimization, agile, lean startup, product management, prioritization, usability testing, user experience, A/B testing, cohort analysis, product strategy, scrum, human-centred design, prototyping, research and development, planning, data analytics, user engagement, mentorship, photography, social networks, biotech.

Freelance or Full-time, I thoroughly enjoy working on the following: Product Experimentation, Rapid Prototyping, Product Strategy, and Product Coaching.
