I'm a <b> Product Manager</b> at <b>Google Search</b>, focused on shaping the future of search through generative AI. My work centers on enhancing the quality and accessibility of AI-powered search for a global audience. This includes improving the accuracy and relevance of generative AI responses, scaling these experiences internationally, improving the quality of generative AI in all languages, designing experiences for multilingual users and Novice Internet Users (NIUs), and pioneering voice-first search in emerging markets to overcome literacy barriers. 

I have 12 years of experience in product management, I've had the opportunity to build products across diverse industries, from wearable and medical technology to social media and search, working within startups, scale-ups, large organizations, and even founding my own. I'm passionate about building impactful products, particularly within tech, online learning, online communities, digital health, and social spaces, with a strong focus on enhancing user experiences and accessibility. My engineering background has driven me to improve how people interact with emerging technology, with a current emphasis on leveraging AI to bridge communication gaps and simplify access to information. This hands-on, multi-faceted experience led me to found, build, and scale Boomerang (2019-2021), a platform connecting over 70,000 baby boomers exploring their passions in retirement.
